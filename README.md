# Kids First Repository Template

Use this template to bootstrap a new Kids First repository.

### Badges

Update the LICENSE badge to point to the new repo location on GitHub.
Note that the LICENSE badge will fail to render correctly unless the repo has
been set to **public**.

Add additional badges for CI, docs, and other integrations as needed within the
`<p>` tag next to the LICENSE.

### Repo Description

This repository will initially serve as a staging point for the source and data files associated with the C2M2 submission process. It might eventually grow into a pipeline for the C2M2 process, but we are starting small.

"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step" -Laozi
